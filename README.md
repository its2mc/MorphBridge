The Morph Bridge application is meant to be an open source application that bridges communication over any and all (most) :D communication channels in existence.

The idea morphed from the bridge application that I developed on top. The bridge app bridged only websocket connections where as the morph bridge will be designed to bridge any communication protocol/channel available on nodejs.
