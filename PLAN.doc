Main idea: The idea for the bridge was to allow for channelled communication between different partners with ease. On a stroke of inspiration, the idea 'morphed' into morph-bridge. The idea of morph-bridge is to provide channelled communication between actors over any communication protocol. The idea will be open source so that any person who wants to set up a fast communication server for multi-protocol, multiplatform, cross-device, light-weight, customizable and free communication can just load the app on their vm and have the applications running on the go.




The main goals of the project would be to
•communicate securely across multiple platforms and devices
•communicate securely on multiple protocols.
•ensure commication is not only fast but secure
•have a fast, easy to use, bootstrappable api for fast communication




The main target protocols for integration are to be:
•zmq
•tcp
•websockets
•ajax get/post requests
•sms *
•mqtt **
•rabbitmq **
•any other protocol that can be implemented.




* will develop a skeleton which can be modified for different gateway apis. Only apis available on nodejs will be used for now.
